            I started doing different experiments with gelatine so that I get to know it as a material. I froze it, ironed it, UV printed it then ground it and mixed it with other substances to see how it reacts. I wanted to push the limits gelatine has because it is highly connected with the food industry and the colourful images related to candies that we have in our minds.</br>

            I want to think of it as a new tool for publishing your work temporarily that can be stored and destroyed anytime. I want it to be about graphic designers who want to have a material that they can do at home with own convenience and then destroy. It is interesting to be able to produce something on your own and apply it to your practice. So, I decided to focus on how this creation and destruction works. I want to make gelatine as a new potential for a new material “that can be destroyed anytime without anyone knowing it”. The destruction of the artwork on this special paper can be interesting if someone wants to convey a message for a short point of time or create a temporary publication. This material is very delicate so, the size of it is relatively small that is due to the fact that the material will crumble so, it can be only be made on a small scale. The benefits of using the small format of this material more efficient to transmit secret meanings or messages via post, if you are brave enough. By using heat, the particles of gelatine respond and become water-soluble. In this manner, the artwork is lost and is transformed into water and ultimately nobody knows anymore of its existence and what had been depicted on it.
